						<h2 class="policyTitle">What I provide</h2>
						<div class="policyText">
							<p>
								As your tutor, there are some things that are,
								and others that are not part of my job. For
								example, it <em>is</em> my job to:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Break down and explain concepts in a clear,
									understandable way
								</li>
								<li>
									Encourage you and help you feel confident
									in your understanding
								</li>
								<li>
									Effectively and completely answer your questions
								</li>
								<li>
									Help you figure out material you've been
									struggling with
								</li>
								<li>
									Treat you with respect, kindness, and dignity
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								It is <em>not</em> my job to:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Do your homework for you, although I'm happy
									to walk through similar problems with you
								</li>
								<li>
									Promise you a certain grade, although I will
									give you the tools you need to get there
								</li>
								<li>
									Keep track of your assignments for you,
									although I have many great tips for
									time-management and organization
								</li>
							</ul>

					<!-- I am human -->
					<div>
						<h2 class="policyTitle">I am human</h2>
						<p class="policyText">
							Though I am very knowledgeable about math and
							computer science, there's always more to learn.
							There may be times when I don't know the answer to
							your question, or I make a mistake. I'm only human!
							My promise to you is that I will use these
							situations as an opportunity to model how to
							overcome academic challenges, and ensure we both
							come out with a better understanding.

					<!-- How we meet -->
					<div>
						<h2 class="policyTitle">How we meet</h2>
						<p class="policyText">
							I am flexible with how we meet. I've used many

							on Android!

					<!-- Late policy -->
					<div>
						<h2 class="policyTitle">Late policy</h2>
						<p class="policyText">
							Life is full of surprises, I completely understand
							that. If you're running late, I'm happy to wait as
							long as you need until you arrive, but the meeting
							will still end as scheduled. I cannot add "extra
							time" at the end of a session to make up for missed
							time at the start.

					<!-- Cancellation policy -->
					<div>

							If you need to cancel or reschedule an appointment,

							appointment. After 24 hours, I will charge for the
							full amount of the session out of respect for both
							my time and other students who may have scheduled
							an appointment then.

							As a tutor, it is my job to aid and strengthen your
							education - not to undermine it. To that extent, I
							will abide by both your school's and your class's
							academic integrity policies to the letter. I am

							Please look elsewhere if your goal is to find
							someone to just take your exams for you.

					<!-- Respect -->
					<div>
						<h2 class="policyTitle">Respect</h2>
						<p class="policyText">
							This one's pretty simple. I will treat you with the
