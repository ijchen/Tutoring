						While a student at the Community College of Rhode Island,

						the <a href="https://www.ccri.edu/success/">Student Success Center</a>,
						which provides tutoring and academic coaching to help
						students achieve success. The director of the Student
						Success Center, Joanne Galliano, reached out to me and
						asked if I wanted to become a peer tutor. At first I
						wasn't sure, since I had never tutored professionally,
						but after consideration I decided to give it a shot and
						become a tutor. This was one of the best decisions I've
						ever made! I absolutely loved being able to share my
						knowledge to help build the confidence and understanding
						of my peers. I tutored math subjects up to pre-calculus,
						as well as many computer science courses. It was an
						incredible experience, and I'm thankful that it showed
						me how fulfilling and enjoyable tutoring can be.

						In my senior year of high school, I participated in a program

						classes full time. These would count for both high school
						<em>and</em> college credits at the same time. This let me
						graduate high school with a full year's worth of college
						credits from the Community College of Rhode Island, where I
						later completed my Associate's degree before transferring to
						the University of Rhode Island.

						One of the after-school activities offered at The Met was an

						up. It quickly became the class I looked forward to the most.
						The teacher took notice of my interest, and recommended
						learning Javascript as a next step. After many months of
						study and practice, I began to feel confident in my Javascript
						abilities. I was able to make small games and programs, and
						was still continuing to learn. Since then I've mastered
						Javascript, as well as learning Java, Python, C++, Node.js,
						Lua, and Processing.

						I went to a high school in Providence called
						<a href="https://www.themethighschool.org/">The Met</a>,
						which focuses on learning through real-world experiences
						and exploring your interests. One of the ways to get
						real-world experiences at The Met is through internships.
						Starting in my freshman year, I interned with The Met's
						<a href="https://ei.themethighschool.org/">Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship</a>.
						With the support of director Jodie Woodruff, I was able
						to learn about the business world and explore my
						entrepreneurial side in a supportive environment. Over
						the first two years of high school, I had the
						opportunity to share my experience at talks and
						conferences including the SxSW education conference in
						Austin Texas, The Big Bang conference in Orlando, and
						many more, from Boston to Ohio. I also explored computer
						history, hardware, and code in my internship with the
						<a href="https://www.ricomputermuseum.org/">Rhode Island Computer Museum</a>.

						I went to a public elementary school, and in my time there I
						became familiar with what works and what doesn't in our
						current education system. In order to focus my studies and
						ensure my classes were challenging enough, my parents decided
						to home school me throughout middle school. That experience
						taught me how to learn independently, and push myself outside
						of my comfort zone.
