						While I was a student at CCRI, some of my professors recommended

						which provides tutoring and academic coaching to help students
						achieve success. The director of the Student Success Center,
						Joanne Galliano, reached out to me and asked if I wanted to
						become a peer tutor. At first I wasn't sure, since I had never
						done any tutoring professionally. After some consideration,
						I decided to give it a shot and become a tutor. This was one
						of the best decisions I've ever made! I absolutely loved being
						able to share my knowledge to help build the confidence and
						understanding of my peers. I tutored math subjects up to
						pre-calculus, as well as many computer science focused classes.
						Unfortunately, only CCRI students are able to be peer tutors,
						so when I transferred I had to part ways with the Student
						Success Center. It was an incredible experience, and I'm thankful
						that it showed me how fulfilling and enjoyable tutoring can be.

						In my senior year of high school, I participated in a program

						classes full time. These would count for both high school
						<em>and</em> college credits at the same time. This let me
						graduate high school with a full year's worth of college
						credits from the Community College of Rhode Island, where I
						later completed my Associate's degree before transferring to

						One of the after-school activities offered at The Met was an

						up. It quickly became the class I looked forward to the most.
						The teacher took notice of my interest, and recommended
						learning Javascript as a next step. After many months of
						study and practice, I began to feel confident in my Javascript
						abilities. I was able to make small games and programs, and
						was still continuing to learn. Since then I've mastered
						Javascript, as well as learning Java, Python, C++, Node.js,
						Lua, and Processing.

						I went to a high school in Providence called
						<a href="https://www.themethighschool.org/" target="_blank">The Met</a>,
						which focuses on learning through real-world experiences
						and exploring your interests. One of the ways to get
						real-world experiences at The Met is through internships.
						Starting in my freshman year, I interned with the Center
						for Innovation and Entrepreneurship. With the support of
						my mentor Jodie Woodruff (the director of the center) I
						was able to learn about the business world and explore my
						entrepreneurial side in a supportive environment. Over
						the first two years of high school, I had the opportunity
						to share my experience at talks and conferences including
						the SxSW education conference in Austin Texas, The Big
						Bang conference in Orlando, and many more, from Boston to
						Ohio. I also explored computer history, hardware, and code
						in my internship with the

						I went to a public elementary school, and in my time there I

						current education system. In order to focus my studies and
						ensure my classes were challenging enough, my parents decided
						to home school me throughout middle school. That experience
						taught me how to learn independently, and push myself outside
						of my comfort zone.
